Microservice Development LifeCycle and Learning Path
I have tried to list all the necessary information which can help individual to see the career path with regards to Agile SDLC.

1. Start with understanding Docker. Docker does not need any programming knowledge and forms the foundation for rest of the steps.

2. Once Docker is completed, I would prefer to undertake the 'Certified Kubernetes Application Developer' Certification. This again does not required in Depth programming knowledge but uses Docker and Orchestrates it.

3. After CKAD, we should go for Cloud Platform - Public Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or Private Cloud (Openstack/Openshift). This helps individual understand the neccesary building blocks in a software from Infrastructure perspective.

4. During this stage - there should be two paths - Development or Devops. Lets say, you are a Java Developer and wants to continue to be a Developer/Architect - I would recommend going for Spring Professional Certification, in case of .NET then it should be Azure Developer. Each language will have its respective certification program, so go for it. Certification will not make you expert but atleast will make you intermediate in that langauge. Along with that go for build tool certification like Jenkins Certified Engineer. Doing the certification after point 1- 3 will give you fair bit of understanding of Infrastructure and Deployment. Hence you can think of end to end solution during development.

5. If you don't like doing development then going for Devops/Infra would like require knowledge of automation tools like Terraform/Ansible along with build tool like Jenkins.

There are some additonal courses/certifications like Certified Scrum Master - this teaches basic of scrum and agile methodology.

Please consider this as my personal opinion. If you would like to get in touch about study materials and how to approach each step then contact me at kavitsh@gmail.com.
