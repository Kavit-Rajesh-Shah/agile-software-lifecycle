Microservice Development LifeCycle and Learning Path
I have tried to list all the necessary information which can help individual to see the career path with regards to Agile SDLC.

1. Start with understanding Docker. Docker does not need any programming knowledge and forms the foundation for rest of the steps.

2. Once Docker is completed, I would prefer to undertake the 'Certified Kubernetes Application Developer' Certification. This again does not required in Depth programming knowledge but uses Docker and Orchestrates it.

3. After CKAD, we should go for Cloud Platform - Public Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) or Private Cloud (Openstack/Openshift). This helps individual understand the neccesary building blocks in a software from Infrastructure perspective.

4. During this stage - there should be two paths - Development or Devops. Lets say, you are a Java Developer and wants to continue to be a Developer/Architect - I would recommend going for one Certification for Programming language like Spring Professional, Azure Developer, Node or respective langauge's certification. Along with that go for Build Tool Certification like Jenkins.
I consider this to be last stage because this is something which you will continue for 2-4 years.

5. If you don't like doing development then going for Devops/Infra would like require kmowledge of Automation tools like Terraform/Ansible along with Build tool like Jenkins.

There are some additonal courses/certifications like Certified Scrum Master - this teaches basic of scrum and agile methodology.

Please consider this as my personal opinion. If you would like to get in touch about study materials and how to approach each step then contact me at kavitsh@gmail.com.

Thanks!!
